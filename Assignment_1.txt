 basically this blockchain is used to store data in security manner 


 2)core problems:
	 Security
	 Decentralization
	 Authentication


 3) Verifiable
    Unchangeable
    Tamper proof
    Immutable


4) Block number
   Records
   Previous block signature
   Mining key

5)         the block chain is verified by block signatures.
    for example : if data is ditributed to 5 computers will tell to create blocks and         signatures, then all computers should get the block signatures same if not there is       somthing wrong. 
           current_block_signature=previous_block_signature+current_block_data
